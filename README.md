# Login in C++
**note:** this project is all followed by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ls9cHMpgvk)

A project that I've made while learning C++
# Index
- To add a user simply add `loginManagerObj.addUser("username", "password");` at the main function
- this will add a user and encrypt the username and password to a strong caeser cypher algorithm
And to just run the login simply add `loginManagerObj.login();` at the main function

# Installation
**Windows**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/OmarHosam/login-in-cpp
cd login-in-cpp
main.exe
```
**Linux**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/OmarHosam/login-in-cpp

You have to compile it by yourself using any compiler (personally using gcc)

**Mac os**
