# Login in C++
**note:** this project is all followed by (this)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ls9cHMpgvk]
A project that I've made while learning C++
# Index
- To add a user simply add `loginManagerObj.addUser("username", "password")`
- this will add a user and encrypt the username and password to a strong caeser cypher algorithm
And to just run the login simply add `loginManagerObj.login()`

# Installation

You have to compile it by yourself using any compiler (personally using gcc)
